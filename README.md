# React Native useCallback Hook Memoization Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug related to the `useCallback` hook in React Native.  The bug arises from incorrectly specifying dependencies, leading to stale closures and unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description
The provided `MyComponent` uses `useCallback` to memoize the `increment` function. However, the dependency array is empty (`[]`), meaning the function is only created once during the initial render.  Subsequent state changes to `count` won't trigger a re-creation of `increment`, leading to `count` always being 0 within the `increment` function.

## Solution
The solution involves correctly specifying the `count` state variable as a dependency in the `useCallback` hook's dependency array. This ensures the `increment` function is recreated whenever `count` changes.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the app.
4. Observe that the counter does not increment correctly.
5. After applying the solution from `bugSolution.js`, the counter should increment correctly.
