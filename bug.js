This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that depends on a state variable.  If the function is memoized incorrectly, it might not update when the state changes, leading to unexpected behavior.  This is often subtle, as the code might appear correct at first glance.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Incorrect: count is captured from the initial render
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means it's only called once

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
